         <h2 style="text-align:center;">About Chris</h2>

       
        
        <!-- 1st Paragraph -->
        <p class="intro" style="text-align:center;">
        
                Chris, also known as my dad, is the person I picked. Not only does he mean everything to me, 
            but I know that us kids is also his everything. He loves hanging out with his family whether that means  
            playing cornhole or just watching tv together. If he's not home, he is either working on a car or hunting. 

        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center;">He works hard for his money to support his family and makes sure his kids have everything they need and want.  
            Chris likes to teach us kids how to do a lot of stuff. If I listed everything, it would take forever,  
            however, some include changing a tire, playing cornhole, changing oil, how to shoot guns, hunt,  
            how to drive a manual car, and so much more. There is a lot of things that he enjoys and most of them 
            have something to do with his family. I am not sure what I would do without him. Growing up, his dad 
            wasnâ€™t really around so he makes sure that he is that good dad that he wanted growing up for all of us. 
            This is so important for him and makes him work just that much harder and always puts his family first. 
            I am not only glad to be lucky to have a dad to show me new things and hobbies, however I am also to have
            a competitor and someone that cares to keep pushing me. This has allowed me to become the person I am today.
            I am so thankful to be able to call Chris Musgrave my dad.
        </p>
