        <!-- 1st Paragraph -->
        <p class="intro">
        
             Chris, also known as my dad is the person I picked. Not only does he mean everything to me,
             but I know that us kids is also his everything. He loves hanging out with his family whether that means 
             playing cornhole or just watching tv together. If he's not home, he is either working or a car or hunting.
